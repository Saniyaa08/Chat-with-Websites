**Understanding RAG:**

A RAG bot, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation bot, enhances the knowledge of our Language Model (LM) by incorporating additional information passed within the prompt. This involves vectorizing the desired text and identifying the most relevant information to augment the LM's understanding, thereby enriching its responses.
